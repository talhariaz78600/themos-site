                    It is a long established fact that a <strong>reader</strong> will be
                    distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its{" "}
                    <strong>layout</strong>. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has
                    a more-or-less normal{" "}
                    <a href="/#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                        distribution of letters.
                    </a>{" "}
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>We want everything to look good out of the box.</li>
                    <li>
                        Really just the first reason, that's the whole point of the plugin.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Here's a third pretend reason though a list with three items looks
                        more realistic than a list with two items.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Typography should be easy</h3>
                <p>
                    So that's a header for you — with any luck if we've done our job
                    correctly that will look pretty reasonable.
                </p>
                <p>Something a wise person once told me about typography is:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Typography is pretty important if you don't want your stuff to look
                        like trash. Make it good then it won't be bad.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    It's probably important that images look okay here by default as well:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I'm going to show you an example of an unordered list to make sure
                    that looks good, too:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>So here is the first item in this list.</li>
                    <li>In this example we're keeping the items short.</li>
                    <li>Later, we'll use longer, more complex list items.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And that's the end of this section.</p>
                <h2>Code should look okay by default.</h2>
                <p>
                    I think most people are going to use{" "}
                    <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">highlight.js</a> or{" "}
                    <a href="https://prismjs.com/">Prism</a> or something if they want to
                    style their code blocks but it wouldn't hurt to make them look{" "}
                    <em>okay</em> out of the box, even with no syntax highlighting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I've written here is probably long enough, but adding this final
                    sentence can't hurt.
                </p>

                <p>Hopefully that looks good enough to you.</p>
                <h3>We still need to think about stacked headings though.</h3>
                <h4>
                    Let's make sure we don't screw that up with <code>h4</code> elements,
                    either.
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Phew, with any luck we have styled the headings above this text and
                    they look pretty good.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's add a closing paragraph here so things end with a decently sized
                    block of text. I can't explain why I want things to end that way but I
                    have to assume it's because I think things will look weird or
                    unbalanced if there is a heading too close to the end of the document.
                </p>

                    What I've written here is probably long enough, but adding this final
